/*
 * ü¶ã Package structure:
 * ¬∑ Service: Refers to the objects implementing use cases (Business Logic).
 * ¬∑ Repository: Refers to the objects working directly with a database.
 * ¬∑ Proxy: Refers to the objects whose responsibilities are to establish communication with something outside the app.
 * ¬∑ Model/Entity: Refers to objects (POJOs) that model the data the app uses.
 *
 * üñçÔ∏è...
 * ¬∑ Interfaces are abstract so, we never use @Component annotation with interfaces.
 * ¬∑ POJO classes not get @Component annotation because we don't use it as dependencies.
 * ¬∑ We need to add the object to the Spring container IF IT EITHER HAS A DEPENDENCY or IF IT IS A DEPENDENCY ITSELF.
 * ¬∑ We add interfaces name as dependencies to the classes. Classes have implementation and might change in the future, but interfaces will not.
 * ¬∑ It is good practice to declare dependencies as private final because they do not change, and we create a constructor right away, and initialize our dependencies.
 *
 * ‚ùóÔ∏èAn Interface might have two or more implementations for different service usages, but Spring will always inject one of them.
 *   We have to specify which implementation we want to use. If we don't specify it, Spring will throw an error.
 *   Ex: CommentPushNotificationProxy & EmailCommentNotificationProxy classes are implemented from CommentNotificationProxy interface.
 * ¬∑ Below are the ways to specify the implementation for Spring:
 *   1. Use the @Primary annotation in class level to mark one of them as default.
 *   2. Use the @Qualifier annotation with the name of the bean and then instruct Spring to inject that bean by name.
 *      2.1. Use @Qualifier("defaultBeanName") annotation in the constructor with the default Bean Name. Ex: @Qualifier("commentPushNotificationProxy").
 *      2.2. Use @Qualifier("customBeanName") annotation in class level and in the constructor by creating custom bean name. Ex: @Qualifier("EMAIL").
