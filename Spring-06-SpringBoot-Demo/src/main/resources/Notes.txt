🦋 Spring Project Structure
· src/main/java: Contains application source code
· src/main/resources: Contains non-java resources
· src/test/java: Contains test code
· mvnw and mwnw.cmd: These are maven wrapper scrips. You can use these scripts to build your project, even if you do not have Maven installed on your machine.
· pom.xml: This is the Maven build specification.
· CompanyApplication.java: This is the Spring boot main class that bootstrapts the project.
· application.properties: This file initially empty but offers a place where you can specify configuration properties.
· static package: Contains any static content(images,css,js,etc)
· templates package: Contains template files that will be used to render content to the browser(Thymeleaf)
· CompanyApplicationTests: This is a simple test class that ensures that the Spring application context loads successfully.
  You will add more tests to the mix as you develop the application.


🔺 Build Specification:
· <parent> : This specifies that your project has spring-boot-starter-parent as its parent POM. This parent POM provides dependency
   management for several libraries commonly used in Spring projects. For those libraries covered by the parent POM, you won't have
   to specify a version because it is inherited from the parent.
· All dependencies have the work starter in their artifact ID.
· Your build file will be significantly smaller and easier to manage because you won't need to declare a dependency on every library you might need.
· You are able to think of your dependencies in terms of what capabilities they provide, rather than their library names(web starter dependency)
· You are freed from the burden of worrying about library versions. You only need to worry about which version of Spring Boot you are using.

Spring Boot plugin:
· It provides a Maven goal that enables you to run the application using maven
· It ensures that all dependency libraries are included within the executable JAR file


************************************************************************************************************************

BootStrapping the application :
· Because you will be running the application from an executable JAR, it is important to have a main class that will be executed when that JAR file is run.
· @SpringBootApplication consists of three annotations:
  1. @SpringBootConfiguration: Designates this class as a configuration class. You can add Java-based Spring framework
     configuration to this class if you need to. This annotation is a specialized form of the @Configuration annotation.
  2. @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot automatic configuration. It tells Spring Boot to automatically
     configure any components that it thinks we will need.
  3. @ComponentScan: Enables component scanning. This lets you declare other classes with annotations like @Component
     to have Spring automatically discover and register them as components in the Spring application context.
· main() method: calls a static run method on the SpringApplication class, which performs the actual bootstrapping of the application,
  creating the Spring application context. The two parameters passed to the run() method are a configuration class and the command-line arguments.
