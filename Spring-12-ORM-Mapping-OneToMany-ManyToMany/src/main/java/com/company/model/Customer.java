 * üåÄ Fetch Types:
 * ¬∑ "fetch = FetchType.LAZY": It will prevent hibernate load all the info from the respective table.
 *    Lazy initialization improves performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and reduce memory requirements.
 * ¬∑ "fetch = FetchType.EAGER": It will bring all the info from the respective table. This might cause a performance issue.
 *    Eager initialization takes more memory consumption and processing speed is slow.
 * ¬∑ Ex: @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
 *       private List<Payment> paymentList;
 * üñçÔ∏è...
 * ¬∑ For example, we only need payment-related information, but the payment class has a merchant object as well. So, when the application starts,
 *   Hibernate will load all the fields and related data in the payment class, which can cause potential performance issues. To prevent that,
 *   we pass "fetch = FetchType.LAZY" into @OneToMany as a parameter. With the lazy initialization approach, merchant will get initialized only when we explicitly call it.
