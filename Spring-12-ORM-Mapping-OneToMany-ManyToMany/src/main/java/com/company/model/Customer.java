/*
 * ü¶ã Fetch Types:
 * ¬∑ LAZY: Fetch when needed. Ex: @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
 *   Lazy initialization improves performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and reduce memory requirements.
 * ¬∑ EAGER: Fetch immediately Ex: @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
 *   Eager initialization takes more memory consumption and processing speed is slow.
 * ¬∑ Default Fetch Types:
 * 1. @OneToOne: FetchType.EAGER
 * 2. @OneToMany: FetchType.LAZY
 * 3. @ManyToOne: FetchType.EAGER
 * 4. @ManyToMany: FetchType.LAZY
 * üñçÔ∏è...
 * ¬∑ For example, we only need payment-related information, but the payment class has a merchant object as well. So, when the application starts,
 *   Hibernate will load all the fields and related data in the payment class, which can cause potential performance issues. To prevent that,
 *   we pass "fetch = FetchType.LAZY" into @OneToMany as a parameter. With the lazy initialization approach, merchant will get initialized only when we explicitly call it.
