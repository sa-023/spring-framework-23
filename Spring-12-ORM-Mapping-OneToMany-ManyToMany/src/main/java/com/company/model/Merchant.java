 * ¬∑ When we just provide the @OneToMany annotation with the "paymentList" field, Hibernate will try to create a foreign
 *   key column in the merchant table, but because "paymentList" is a list, it creates an additional table in DB named merchants_payment_list.
 *   So we have to annotate paymentList with @OneToMany(mappedBy = "merchant") to prevent that.

 *       private List<Payment> paymentList;
