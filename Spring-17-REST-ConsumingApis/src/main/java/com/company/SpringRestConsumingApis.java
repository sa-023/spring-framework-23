/*
 * ðŸ¦‹ Consuming Rest Endpoints
 * Â· In application world, not only the client of a web app may call the backend, but also two backend components may
 *   communicate one with the other to accomplish their responsibilities.
 * Â· In backend solution composed of multiple services, these components need to speak to exchange data. When we implement
 *   such a service using Spring, we need to know how to call a REST endpoint exposed by another service.
 * Â· There are three ways to call REST endpoints from a Spring app:
 * 1. OpenFeign: A tool offered by the Spring Cloud project.
 * 2. RestTemplate: A tool developers use since Spring 3.
 * 3. WebClient: A Spring feature presented as an alternative to RestTemplate by the Spring documentation.

 *    We used the above webpage for 3rd party API conversion to an entity.
