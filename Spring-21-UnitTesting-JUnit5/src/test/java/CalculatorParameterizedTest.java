/*
 * ðŸ”º Unit Testing:
 * Â· Designed to test specific sections of code (Method, Class).
 * Â· Percentage of lines of code tested is code coverage. Ideal coverage is in the 70-80% range.
 * Â· Should be â€˜unityâ€™ and execute very fast.
 * Â· Should have no external dependencies.
 * ðŸ”º Integration Testing:
 * Â· Designed to test behaviors between objects and parts of the overall system.
 * Â· Much Larger Scope.
 * Â· Can include database, spring context, message brokers, etc.
 * Â· Will run much slower than unit tests.
 *
 * ðŸ¦‹ TDD vs BDD
 * ðŸ”º TDD (Test Driven Development): Writes test first, which will fail, then code to fix test
 * Â· The process starts by writing a test case.
 * Â· TDD focuses on how the functionality is implemented.
 * Â· Test cases are written in a programming language.
 * Â· Changes in how the application functions impact a lot on the test cases in TDD.
 * Â· Collaboration is required only between the developers.
 * Â· Some of the tools which support TDD are: JUnit, TestNG, NUnit, etc.
 * Â· Tests in TDD can only be understood by people with programming knowledge.
 * Â· TDD reduces the likelihood of having bugs in your tests.
 * ðŸ”º BDD (Behavior Driven Development): Builds on TDD and specifies that tests of any unit software should be specified in terms of desired behavior of the unit
 * Â· The process starts by writing a scenario as per the expected behavior.
 * Â· BDD focuses on the behavior of an application for the end user.
 * Â· Scenarios are more readable when compared to TDD as they are written in simple English format.
 * Â· BDD scenarios are not much impacted by the functionality changes.
 * Â· Collaboration is required between all the stakeholders.
 * Â· Some of the tools which support BDD are SpecFlow, Cucumber, MSpec, etc.
 * Â· Tests in BDD can be understood by any person including the ones without any programming knowledge
 * Â· Bugs in tests are difficult to track when compared to TDD.
 *
 * ðŸ¦‹ Annotations
 * Â· @Test: It is used to define a certain method as test method.
 * Â· @BeforeEach: It is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed before each @Test method in the current class.
 * Â· @AfterEach:  It is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed after each @Test method in the current class.
 * Â· @BeforeAll: It is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed before all tests in the current test class. The @BeforeAll method must be static.
 * Â· @AfterAll: It is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed after all tests in the current test class. The @AfterAll method must be static.
 * Â· Parameterized Tests(@ParameterizedTest): @ValueSource @MethodSource @CsvSource @CsvFileSource
 *   1. @ValueSource: It is used to provide a single parameter per test method. It lets you specify an array of literals or primitive types.
 *   2. @MethodSource: It is used to specify a factory method for test arguments.
 *      This method can be present in the same class or any other class too.
 *      The factory method should be static and return Stream, Iterable or array elements.
 *   3. @CsvSource: It is used to run tests that take a comma-separated values as arguments.
 *   4. @CsvFileSource: If we have to write a lot of test data in the test code it can make test less readable.
 *      One solution to this is to provide the data in an external CSV file. Each line from the file works as a list of parameters.
 *   5. @EmptySource: passes a single empty argument to the annotated method.
 *   6. @NullSource: passes a single null argument to the annotated method.
 *   7. @NullAndEmptySource: passes a single null argument to the annotated method and then passes a single empty argument to the annotated method.
 *
 * ðŸ¦‹ Assertions
 * Â· assertTrue(); asserts that the supplied condition is true or boolean condition supplied by BooleanSupplier is true.
 * Â· assertArrayEquals(); It is used to verify if the two arrays are equals.
 * Â· assertNotNull(); method asserts that actual is NOT null.
 * Â· assertNull(); method asserts that actual is null.
 * Â· assertNotSame(); asserts that expected and actual DO NOT refer to the same object.
 * Â· assertSame(); method asserts that expected and actual refer to exactly same object.
 * Â· assertThrows(); It is used to test exception cases in JUnit5.
 *   It asserts that execution of the supplied executable throws an exception of the expectedType and returns the exception.
 *   If no exception is thrown, or if an exception of a different type is thrown, this method will fail.
