/*
 * ü¶ã Integration Testing
 * ¬∑ Once different modules are developed and integrated, integration testing is carried out. Its primary goal is to identify
 *   problems that arise during end-to-end user request processing when several modules interact with one another.
 * ¬∑ In terms of a typical Spring Boot Crud application, unit tests can be written to test REST controllers, DAO layers,
 *   etc. separately. It will not require even the embedded server.
 * ¬∑ In integration testing, we shall focus on testing complete request processing from the controller to the persistence layer.
 *   The application shall run inside an embedded server to create the application context and all beans. Some of these beans may be overridden to mock certain behaviors.
 *
 * üñçÔ∏è...
 * ¬∑ The spring-boot-starter-test is the primary dependency that contains the majority of elements required for our tests.
 *
 * ü¶ã MockMvc
 * ¬∑ The Spring MockMvc class is part of the Spring test framework and helps in testing the controllers by explicitly starting a Servlet container.
 * ¬∑ MockMvc is a mocked servlet environment that we can use to test our HTTP controller endpoints without the need to launch our embedded servlet (Tomcat) container.
 * ¬∑ While MockMvc is a mocked environment, it still comes with HTTP semantics so that we can test the serialization, HTTP status codes, and return types of our endpoints.
 *
 * ü¶ã Annotations
 * üîπ @WebMvcTest: It is used Spring MVC controllers. It allows us to test the behavior of controllers, request mappings, and HTTP responses in a controlled and isolated
 *    environment. By using @WebMvcTest, we can narrow down the scope of testing to just the web layer, without loading the entire application context.
 *    @WebMvcTest annotation-based test runs faster because it will load only the specified controller and its dependencies without loading the entire application.
 *    Includes both the @AutoConfigureWebMvc and the @AutoConfigureMockMvc, among other functionality.
 * üîπ @SpringBootTest: This annotation creates an application context and loads the full application context. It is used for integration testing.
 *    It will bootstrap the full application context, which means we can @Autowire any bean that's picked up by component scanning into our test.
 *    It starts the embedded server, creates a web environment, and then enables @Test methods to do integration testing.
 *    It will use SpringApplication to load the ApplicationContext. By default, it will not start a server, but it will provide a mock environment.
 * üîπ @AutoConfigureMockMvc: It autoconfigures the MockMvc. It allows us to add a MockMvc instance to our ApplicationContext,
 *    so we can make HTTP requests against our controller.
 * üîπ @MockBean: We use it to add mock objects to the Spring application context. The mock will replace any existing bean of the same type in the application context.
 *    If no bean of the same type is defined, a new one will be added. This annotation is useful in integration tests where a particular bean,
 *    like an external service, needs to be mocked.
 *
 * ‚ùóÔ∏è@SpringBootTest vs @WebMvcTest
 * ¬∑ @SpringBootTest will load the complete application and autowire all the beans, which makes it a bit slow.
 * ¬∑ @WebMvcTest is only going to scan the controller you've defined and the MVC infrastructure. So if our controller has some dependency
 *   to other beans from our service layer, the test won't start until we either load that config ourselves or provide a mock for it.
 *   This is much faster as we only load a tiny portion of your app. This annotation uses slicing.
 *
 * üñçÔ∏è...
 * ¬∑ MockMvcRequestBuilders class: We build our requests by using the static methods of this class.
 * ¬∑ perform(RequestBuilder requestBuilder): We execute requests by calling this method.
 * ¬∑ MockMvcResultMatchers class: We write assertions for the received response by using the static methods of this class.
 * ¬∑ MockMvcResultHandlers class: We use it for assertion as well.
 *
